# Machine-Learning
Hello 
in this repository we want to do some projects in machine learning step by step. we start with simple projects and we're going to do more complex projects after them.

the first project is:
1. Exploration Data Analysis
in this simple code we can learn how we can Exploration Data Analysis (EDA) on our dataset and simply see what' going on in our dataset. it's help to have a better site about the dataset and then we can do the future tasks better.
tip: this code also needs a csv file (googleplaystore.csv) to run, which is our dataset.
